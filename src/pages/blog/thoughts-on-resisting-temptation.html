<p>
I do not claim to be a master of Resisting Temptation. I am barely a Novice.
I do have some thoughts on the matter, however, mainly from observing my own
struggles with resisting temptation. I will discuss two approaches to resisting
temptation which I have found to not work, and I will offer changes to both
approaches which have allowed much greater progress in defeating temptation.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, a habit which I have found to not work when attempting to stop a
certain habit or behavior is to tell yourself that you will quit the habit
right then and there - Cold Turkey. Why doesn't this work? Let's say, for
example, that your goal is stop watching / streaming T.V. when you currently
watch several hours of T.V. each and every day. If you drop down to zero hours
of T.V. a day then you will go crazy. You will likely not succeed in the
endeavor. A object watching will continue watching T.V... At this point in your
life, part of your brain has been chemically and physically altered such that
T.V. is a welcome routine. Likely, your brain's reward system is partially
linked to watching T.V. - doing so makes you happy. If you suddenly stop
engaging in an activity which makes you happy, you will most definitely become
bored and sad. You don't want to feel bored and sad, though. So what do you do?
You watch T.V., and you feel happy again. Once you inevitably fall back into
your old routine of watching T.V., you will likely feel bad about yourself and
think thoughts along the lines of "I promised I would stop, but I didn't succeed
because I am a failure", or "I couldn't quit, it was too difficult", and maybe
you will remember other times in your life when you failed at something and you
will further reinforce your negative feelings. The negative feelings are
something you don't want to experience though. You want to be happy and be
distracted from your guilt and shame. As an act of compensation, you watch more
T.V. The cycle continues.
</p>

<p>
A second approach to resisting temptation that I have found to not work well is
keeping your goals to yourself and only yourself. Having a thought like "I am
now going to stop watching T.V." is too easy. There is nothing at stake when you
have a thought like this and there is no one to hold you accountable to this
"goal" except for yourself (and this may not work if you have a bad track record
when it comes to resisting temptation.) A thought is such a fleeting thing and
when it has no manifestation in reality - likely because you keep it in your
head - then nothing will change.
</p>

<p>
At this point, I have listed some pitfalls in common approaches taken to resist
temptation. Now I offer two complementary remedies. To start, one shouldn't set
goals and hopes so high up. Resetting a habit (while it can be done overnight)
takes time. In the ase of watching T.V., simply cut back how much you watch each
day in small increments (say 10 minutes, or one episode.) Additionally, reward
yourself when you succeed at reducing your habit at each increment. Your brain
may be likened to that of a child: it must be rewarded for every slight step in
the right direction, otherwise it may just run off to whatever it was doing
before because the new activity was not rewarding enough. Another note, you will
now have more resources (time, money, etc.) and you should put those resources
towards reinforcing a habit or activity that you actually want to engage in (the
superego / parental part of your brain, not the child-like reward center.) Also,
don't punish yourself when you slip-up (this will scare away the child.) Be
realistic with your blunders; accept that you're human and that you will make
these mistakes (everyone makes mistakes) and that getting upset at yourself does
nothing to help. Analyze what caused the slip-up, what part of your plan didn't
work, and then readjust your plan and strategy accordingly (were you too
ambitious with the amount of T.V. you were taking away? Try smaller steps.)
</p>

<p>
The second remedy is to get other people in on your goal. As I mentioned, just
having the thought of wanting to do better is hardly going to do anything for
you. There is nothing at stake because you already can tell yourself anything.
When you admit your problem to a group friends however, and you tell them what
you hope to accomplish, then you are more likely to commit to your goal. Your
thought became manifested in real life and there are people to hold you
accountable for improving. Friends and family will check-in on your goal and ask
about your progress (this is not something you would do by yourself.) When you
run into failure and hardship, friends (if they are any good) will talk you
through the problems you are having and may even help you evaluate a better
strategy. As a person who really cares about and admires people, I believe
that people can truly help you become better. If you don't have this experience,
then you may need re-evaluate what "friend" means to you, who your friends are
and how you treat people
</p>

<p>
One last detail: resisting temptation is made ridiculously easier with the
practice of Meditation and Mindfulness. You will learn to calm you mind, view
thoughts as just thoughts that do not reflect reality (rather than let boredom
and a lack of reward push you back into temptation) and meditation in general is
great for helping to deal with life - stress, emotions. I recommend everyone
look into meditating.
