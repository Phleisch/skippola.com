Get a sheet of rice paper wet until it fails to maintain structure and starts becoming sticky. Place a handful of ingredients on the paper in the bottom third, leaving plenty of room on the side. Fold over the side of the rice paper closest to the ingredients. Tuck the side under the ingredients. Fold the outer edges tightly onto the ingredients. Roll the paper to completion.", "Key idea to rolling your spring rolls is to keep it tight!"]
