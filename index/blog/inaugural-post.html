	For most of my life I've wanted to have my own website. Here and there I
	would dabble in creating static pages viewable only on my computer using
	HTML, CSS and JS. In my head I've thought over and over about the design
	I would have, all the elements that would be involved, cool tools that the
	website would display. The actual website was trapped inside my mind with no
	way to get out. I didn't just want to have a website though, I wanted to be
	involved in every part of the creation of the website. I wanted to build
	this whole thing from scratch - and you will learn that I like to do this
	for most things, to my own demise. So I would not be satisfied with using
	a website builder, or an framework for the frontend, or even web server
	(like Nginx.) So, while I've wanted to fulfill this small dream of mine for
	quite some time, I made achieving that goal much harder than need be.
	Finally, several months ago before leaving for an exchange semester in
	Sweden, I bought service space for hosting a website and I bought my own
	domain - skippola.com (which was another challenge, because I spent months
	trying to decide what the perfect domain name would be.) Of course, after
	setting up the site and creating an index page, I didn't touch skippola.com
	for nearly 3 months. There was a constant nagging coming from the back of my
	mind that I should really spent some work on this personal project. So,
	before my own conscious drove me insane, I revisited the site and have now
	added a blog section and this as the first blog.

	My upcoming plans for this website are to update this blogging system I have
	in place. Currently the system is heavily based off of
	<a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith's</a>
	<a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">lb</a> script. Luke's script
	works great as a start, but I have a different blog format in mind and so
	will do some work setting that up. Likely, the next post on this site will
	be about my planned design of the blog system for skippola.com. That's all
	for now. Hej då!
