	<h2>Cause and Goals</h2>
	<p>
	Years ago, when I turned 18, I immediately sought out a bank to store my
	savings in - partially out of necessity, partially to claim a nugget of
	personal freedom and get out of the shared bank account I had with my mom.
	At the time, I didn't know too much about what I needed in a Bank, I just
	knew that a larger interest rate meant more money, and thus I opened up an
	account with Discover - an Online Bank that could afford to give customers
	larger interest rates than the Brick-N-Mortar banks of Wells Fargo, Chase,
	etc...
	</p>
	<p>
	Now, I've come to learn much about how banks operate, the fees they may
	have, and generally what I'm looking for. Primarily, the most impactful
	bit of information I've learned about banks is that one large way they
	make money is through ROI from investing their customers' money into
	literally whatever they desire. Caring greatly about sustainability and
	the Climate Crisis issue, I of course want to support a bank that invests
	my money into businesses and ventures which support my interests...
	Mainly that of funding green-tech, ethical companies, small and local
	business, etc. This, of course, is not the case with Discover Bank (not
	to call them out specifically, as the same could be said with all major
	US banks.)
	</p>
	<p>
	Thus, the issue is to find a bank that "ethically" and sustainably
	invests the money I put into their
	savings/checkings account. To make the task more difficult, there are some
	other conditions I require of the bank to open an account with. In
	particular, I must be able to do everything via a web app (or in person) and
	not be subjected to using a mobile app for specific functionality (more on
	this later.) Softer restrictions include being able to create multiple
	savings accounts relatively easily and without any additional costs, also
	management of my accounts in general should be low maintenance - I don't
	want to put in a lot of work just to avoid stupid fees or anything like
	that. One last condition is that the bank be compatible with Plaid so I can
	automate the creation of an expense spreadsheet (this should be fine, Plaid
	is highly versatile.) To make things easier... Having a poor interest rate
	on my savings account (&lt; .1%) is NOT a deal breaker. In general, my goals
	can be summed up as: find a place where I can park my money that is easy to
	access but which does not require a lot of maintenance and where I know my
	money is being used for "good" rather than being used to fund some
	monstrosity.
	</p>

	<h2>The Search</h2>
	<p>
	So, what exactly did my search consist of? I began with blanket internet
	searches such as "ethical banks", "green banks", and curated a hefty list
	of related websites. Most of these sites were either individuals' personal
	reviews of whatever banks they are a fan of, or a "Top X Banks" list which
	was backed up with hardly any sources. I also looked specifically at B
	Corporation certified banks, knowing that such banks would be much more
	ethical and dedicated to community investment compared to larger banks.
	All in all, this search resulted in the following candidates: Aspiration,
	Atmos Bank, Ando, or some small local bank / Credit Union. But then the list
	began to shrink...
	</p>
	<p>
	Aspiration would not be making the cut. I actually
	tried Aspiration (really jumping the gun, thinking I had found the perfect
	solution to this banking dilemma) but came across many issues with it.
	Firstly, a lot of the functionality I need to manage my savings and
	checkings accounts with Aspiration is limited through in-App usage. This is
	unacceptable for a couple of reasons: management of accounts would be much
	easier (manually and through automation) in a Web App. As well, I just
	don't want to be tied down to my phone. I use my phone almost solely for
	texting, calling, music and web searches and I don't want to use it for
	anything else beyond that. Really what it boils down to is that I want the
	freedom to access and manage my accounts from multiple platforms, especially
	in the case of Aspiration where banking in person is NOT an option. Another
	issue with Aspiration: with the base / free version of the Savings and
	Checkings account, you cannot make money at all except for the very limited
	cash back offering from purchases made at a very small subset of stores. If
	you do want an interest rate, however, you must pay a monthly fee and also
	do like a million different things to really be eligible that I'm not going
	to do because it's too high maintenance, which means that I'm just going to
	lose money because the interest rate is not going to beat the steep monthly
	rate. Also, Aspiration is not an actual bank, which brings up a lot of other
	issues...
	</p>
	<p>
	To sum up, after hours of mind melting searching, I came to the following
	conclusions: "Green Banks" that have Savings or Checkings accounts available
	are few and far between; a Credit Union or local bank is better than a
	large bank and I should just never use a large bank for Savings and Checking
	accounts; it's not worth the effort to find the perfect bank just for
	Checking and Savings accounts. Many "Ethical" or "Green" banks I came across
	are not based in my Country nor in my State, and thus I cannot open accounts
	with those banks. If I could, I would totally open an account with one of
	those banks and I would have called it a day long ago, but I don't have that
	choice. So now I'm thinking I will just go with a local bank / Credit Union.
	This is a great option because you know that a good portion (if not all) of
	the assets managed by the bank will be invested locally, also you will
	have a place to go to in person (just in case.) The issue with local banks
	is that they are smaller and thus less likely to have much of a digital
	presence. Likely, this means relaxing my "must be capatible with Plaid"
	condition which is fine. The last thing I have to say about my conclusions
	is simply: don't over think it. I'm resolved to the idea that I am not
	going to find the perfect fit according to what I said above - the scene
	for ethical banks is just not mature enough. There are some "Green" Banks
	which seem like a great solution but are just too new, like Atmos Bank,
	which at the time of this writing only offers a Savings Account but no
	Checking Account. I'm pretty happy settling with a local bank though - I
	think this is beneficial for my local community which I care for greatly.
